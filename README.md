## Why are the cross-domain learning on graphs important?
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful cross-domain capabilities, attracting a large number of researchers. Although cross-domain graph learning has always been an important research direction, existing works on tackling cross-domain tasks are not as effective as LLMs. Inspired by the powerful cross-domain abilities of LLMs, cross-domain graph learning has once again become a focal point of attention. This is also a critical issue that must be resolved before truly proposing graph foundation models.

This repo aims to provide a curated list of research papers that explore cross-domain learning on graphs. 
<!--
 **It is based on our Survey Paper: [Graph Prompt Learning: A Comprehensive Survey and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16534)**. -->
We will try to make this list updated frequently. If you find any error or any missed paper, please don't hesitate to open issues or pull requests.🌹
