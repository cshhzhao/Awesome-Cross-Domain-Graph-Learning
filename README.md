## Why are the cross-domain learning on graphs important?
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful cross-domain capabilities, attracting a large number of researchers. Although cross-domain graph learning has always been an important research direction, existing works on tackling cross-domain tasks are not as effective as LLMs. Inspired by the powerful cross-domain abilities of LLMs, cross-domain graph learning has once again become a focal point of attention. This is also a critical issue that must be resolved before truly proposing graph foundation models.

This repo aims to provide a curated list of research papers that explore the cross-domain learning on graphs.
